## Jibber Jabber with Jim

I worked with [Jim](https://jamesdavidson.xyz) to build cohesive branding that encompassed his personal brand and his radio hosting endeavours. We curated an old comic-book style theme in a blue and white colourstory, with all elements of the package available to edit with ease on Canva.

## Alex's Brewskis

I worked together with Alex to create a vintage-style cocktail menu in a tan and green colourstory, with all elements available to edit with ease on Canva.

## Luna Jay Studios

During my time at the University of Plymouth, I created branding for myself! Playing off my namesake, I used moon iconography and a purple-based colourstory to create an invoice template, business card, postcards, and a creative CV.
